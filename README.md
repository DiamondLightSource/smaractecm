Smaract ECM Support Module
===========================

This module provides EPICS support for The SmarAct SmarPod via an
ECM Controller.

The SmarPod is a 6-axis piezo stage e.g.
[SmarPod](https://www.smaract.com/en/smarpod/product/smarpod-cls-32).

[MCS](https://www.smaract.com/en/control-systems-and-software/product/mcs2)
Units are used to drive the individual axes.

The [ECM Controller](https://www.smaract.com/en/control-systems-and-software/product/ecm), provides a high level interface to the MCS units and implements
the kinematics for the SmarPod.
